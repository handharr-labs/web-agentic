## Summary Scores

| Dimension | Score | Rating | Key Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 · Orchestration Quality | 5/10 | Fair | Non-standard agent types (feature-planner/feature-worker) for a debug task; ViewController read 9× suggests loose coordination |
| D2 · Worker Invocation | 4/10 | Poor | feature-worker spawned for a debug/fix task — debug-worker was the correct type |
| D3 · Skill Execution | 7/10 | Good | Debug skill sequence correct (debug-orchestrator → add-logs → remove-logs); tracker-adjust-ticket called twice (duplicate) |
| D4 · Token Efficiency | 5/10 | Fair | read_grep_ratio of 22 (P7 violation); 3 duplicate read paths; cache hit ratio excellent at 95.6% |
| D5 · Routing Accuracy | 5/10 | Fair | Branch prefix is feature/ but task is a bug fix; feature-worker spawned instead of debug-worker |
| D6 · Workflow Compliance | 8/10 | Good | Specific file git-add used; no --no-verify; debug-orchestrator correctly triggered; work on feature branch |
| D7 · One-Shot Rate | 7/10 | Good | 1 rejected tool; 3 duplicate read paths (-1.5); user/assistant turn ratio 0.79 (borderline) |
| **Overall** | **5.9/10** | **Fair** | |

| Read | 22 |
| Bash | 17 |
| Edit | 16 |
| Skill | 5 |
| ToolSearch | 3 |
| Agent | 2 |
| AskUserQuestion | 1 |

Read:Grep ratio: 22 (target < 3 — high ratio signals full-file reads over targeted search; Grep tool was not used at all; bash grep commands were used instead but do not reduce the Read tool call count)

## Agent & Skill Invocations

| Component | Args / Description | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Skill: debug-orchestrator | Accuracy circle (GMSCircle) not showing on the map in CICOLo | Correct entry point for a debug task |
| Skill: debug-add-logs | Add [DebugTest] debug logs to trace the accuracy circle rendering | Correct debug workflow step |
| Skill: debug-remove-logs | (empty) | Correct cleanup after root cause identified |
| Skill: tracker-adjust-ticket | temp-dir/TE-14691.md | Appropriate ticket update |
| Skill: tracker-adjust-ticket | temp-dir/TE-14691.md | Duplicate call — same args, same file |
| Agent: feature-planner | Feature planning for TE-14691 GPS accuracy circle | Wrong agent type — this is a debug/fix task, not a new feature |
| Agent: feature-worker | Execute TE-14691 GPS accuracy circle feature plan | Wrong agent type — debug-worker should have been used |

## Findings

### What went well

- Cache efficiency was excellent at 95.6%, saving approximately $26.51 compared to uncached input pricing.
- The debug skill sequence (debug-orchestrator → debug-add-logs → debug-remove-logs → tracker-adjust-ticket) correctly follows the debug workflow.
- Git staging used specific file paths, not `-A` or `.`, complying with the project workflow rules.
- No `--no-verify` flag was used; hooks were respected throughout.
- The single rejected tool call is low and did not cascade into significant rework.
- Bitbucket PR tools were used to retrieve and update the PR, indicating the session completed end-to-end delivery.

### Issues found

- **[D2]** `feature-planner` and `feature-worker` were spawned for a bug-fix task. The correct agent for this work is `debug-worker` (coordinated by `debug-orchestrator`). The agent descriptions confirm this was a fix ("GPS accuracy circle not showing"), not a new feature. This means the subagent type selection logic in the feature-planner/feature-worker pipeline was triggered when it should not have been.

- **[D1]** `CICOLocationViewController.swift` was read 9 times and `CICOLocationViewModel.swift` was read 5 times within the session. This volume of re-reads on the same files suggests the worker lacked a persistent working context and repeatedly re-loaded source files to answer incremental questions — a coordination failure.

- **[D4]** `read_grep_ratio` of 22 — the Read tool was called 22 times with no Grep tool calls at all (bash grep was used instead via shell). Files like `CICOLocationViewController.swift` (9 reads) and `CICOLocationViewModel.swift` (5 reads) should have been searched with the Grep tool to extract only relevant sections (e.g., `accuracyCircle`, `updateAccuracyCircle`, `userLocation`). This inflated token consumption unnecessarily.

- **[D4]** 3 duplicate read paths: `TE-14691.md` (read 2×), `CICOLocationViewModel.swift` (read 5× — effectively 4 duplicates), `CICOLocationViewController.swift` (read 9× — effectively 8 duplicates). Each re-read beyond the first is wasted cache-read token spend.

- **[D5]** The session is on branch `feature/TE-14689_...` and TE-14691 is a bug (accuracy circle not rendering). A `fix/TE-14691_...` branch would have been the semantically correct prefix. The mismatch suggests routing was not re-evaluated when the sub-issue TE-14691 was identified as a defect.

- **[D3]** `tracker-adjust-ticket` was called twice with identical arguments (`temp-dir/TE-14691.md`). The second call was redundant and added unnecessary overhead.

> **Low score on D1?** Review `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md` — look for missing precondition checks that distinguish debug tasks from feature tasks, and whether the orchestrator should gate on `debug-orchestrator` output before spawning feature-planner.

> **Low score on D2?** Review `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-worker.md` — look for ambiguous scope that allows it to be invoked for bug-fix work, and add a precondition guard: if the issue describes a rendering defect rather than a new capability, route to `debug-worker` instead.

> **Low score on D4?** The Read tool was used exclusively where Grep would have sufficed. Review agent prompts to enforce the search protocol: Grep for specific symbols first, Read only if the full file structure is required.

> **Low score on D5?** Routing evaluation should inspect the issue description for defect keywords ("not showing", "missing", "broken") before selecting agent types and branch prefix. Add a routing classification step to the debug-orchestrator or feature-orchestrator entry point.

## Recommendations

1. **Add debug-vs-feature routing guard** — Before spawning `feature-planner`, the entry point agent should classify the issue as defect or new capability. Defect signals (e.g. "not showing", "not rendering", "missing") should route directly to `debug-orchestrator` → `debug-worker`, never to `feature-planner`. Update `feature-orchestrator.md` with this precondition check.

2. **Enforce Grep-first search protocol in worker agents** — Workers read `CICOLocationViewController.swift` nine times. Agent prompts should instruct workers to extract only the relevant symbol (via Grep or targeted Read with offset+limit) rather than loading the full file repeatedly. A single targeted Grep for `accuracyCircle` would have replaced 8 of those 9 reads.

3. **Deduplicate tracker-adjust-ticket invocations** — The skill was called twice with identical arguments. Add an idempotency guard in the skill definition or in the calling agent: only call `tracker-adjust-ticket` once per session unless the ticket content has changed.

4. **Align branch prefix with task type** — TE-14691 is a defect ticket. When the session creates or continues work on a defect, ensure the branch is prefixed `fix/` not `feature/`. This can be enforced via a branch-naming check in the routing step.

5. **Persist working context across worker sub-turns** — The repeated re-reads suggest the worker did not maintain a cached view of the file contents across its internal turns. Passing file content as context at agent spawn (or using a summarised context.md) would eliminate redundant reads within a single agent invocation.

## Effort vs Billing

### Token cost breakdown

| Token type | Count | Unit price | Cost (USD) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Input | 217 | $3.00 / MTok | $0.00 |
| Cache creation | 462,038 | $3.75 / MTok | $1.73 |
| Cache reads | 9,948,939 | $0.30 / MTok | $2.98 |
| Output | 95,150 | $15.00 / MTok | $1.43 |
| **Total** | **557,405 billed-equiv** | | **~$6.15** |

Cache hit ratio of **95.6%** was the primary cost saver — without it, the same session would have cost approximately **$32.66** at full input rates (all 10.4M tokens at $3.00/MTok input + $1.43 output), representing a saving of ~$26.51 (81% cost reduction).

### Where the tokens went

| Task | Estimated tokens | % of total | Productive? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Debug orchestration and planning (feature-planner spawn, context load) | ~55,000 | ~10% | ⚠️ Overhead (wrong agent type — should have been debug-worker directly) |
| Repeated reads of CICOLocationViewController.swift (9 reads) | ~135,000 | ~24% | ❌ Rework (8 of 9 reads were redundant re-reads) |
| Repeated reads of CICOLocationViewModel.swift (5 reads) | ~50,000 | ~9% | ❌ Rework (4 of 5 reads were redundant re-reads) |
| Debug log injection and removal (debug-add-logs, debug-remove-logs, bash greps) | ~80,000 | ~14% | ✅ Productive |
| Root cause analysis and fix authoring (Edit calls × 16) | ~120,000 | ~22% | ✅ Productive |
| Ticket and PR update (tracker-adjust-ticket × 2, mmpa PR tools) | ~45,000 | ~8% | ⚠️ Overhead (one tracker call was duplicate) |
| Session extraction and tooling overhead | ~72,405 | ~13% | ⚠️ Overhead |
| **Total** | **~557,405** | **100%** | |

**Productive work: ~36% (~200,000 tokens / ~$2.22)**
**Wasted on rework: ~33% (~185,000 tokens / ~$2.05)**

### Effort-to-value ratio

| Deliverable | Complexity | Tokens spent | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPS accuracy circle rendering fix (CICOLocationViewController.swift) | Medium | ~185,000 | Poor — 9 reads of the same file inflated cost 8× beyond the single-read baseline |
| ViewModel accuracy circle wiring fix (CICOLocationViewModel.swift) | Low | ~70,000 | Poor — 5 reads of the same file when 1 targeted read + Grep would suffice |
| Ticket update (TE-14691.md) | Low | ~45,000 | Fair — tracker-adjust-ticket called twice with same args |

### Key insight

The single highest-cost item was `CICOLocationViewController.swift`, which consumed an estimated 135,000 tokens — roughly 24% of the entire session budget — due to being read nine separate times. This is a direct consequence of the worker lacking persistent file context across its internal turns: each sub-turn that needed to inspect or modify the ViewController loaded the full file from disk again rather than retaining the previously read content. For a file of moderate size, a single Grep for `accuracyCircle` followed by one targeted Read with offset and limit would have replaced all nine full-file reads. Fixing the Grep-first protocol in the worker agent prompt is the single change with the highest token-efficiency impact for future sessions of this type.
