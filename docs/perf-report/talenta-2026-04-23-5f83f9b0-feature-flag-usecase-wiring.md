## Agent & Skill Invocations

| Component | Args / Description | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Skill: plan-feature | plan-feature (ticket TE-14689) | ✓ Correct skill for pre-execution planning |
| Agent: feature-planner | Feature planning for TE-14689 feature flag + API call | ✓ Produced a focused, accurate plan |
| Agent: feature-orchestrator | Execute TE-14689 feature flag + use case wiring | ✓ Delivered all 3 file changes correctly |
| Agent: feature-orchestrator | Move fetchAllLocation call to viewDidLoad event | ✓ Corrected placement; used feature-orchestrator as required but added cost for a 1-line fix |

## Findings

### What went well

- Grep-first discipline was excellent — 8 grep calls vs 3 reads gives a 0.4 ratio, well below the target of < 3.
- Cache performance was strong at 95.1%, cutting the session cost from ~$9.45 to ~$1.69.
- The agent correctly consulted the feature-planner before execution and validated the strict-location guard condition (`isFlexibleLocation`) against real code before committing it to the plan — this prevented a wrong-field bug from reaching execution.
- Git hygiene was excellent: specific file paths in `git add`, issue prefix on both commits, no hook bypasses, work on the correct feature branch.
- The agent correctly stopped and asked the user for routing preference when the delegation guard triggered mid-session, rather than resolving it autonomously — this is the correct CLAUDE.md-mandated behaviour.
- Plan.md was iteratively refined (3 edits) before handing off to feature-orchestrator, resulting in a clean first execution pass.

### Issues found

- **[D3]** ViewModel direct edit was correct — `presentation-worker` applied its Task Assessment rule (public contract change without skill coverage → direct edit is the correct fallback). `pres-update-stateholder` does not yet cover use case injection (constructor + property + init wiring is a multi-touch-point change beyond the skill's current scope). No violation recorded.
- **[D3]** Feature flag changes to `MekariFlagResponse.swift` / `MekariFlagCustomProvider.swift` are outside Clean Architecture layers — feature flag machinery is a cross-cutting concern, not a domain/data/presentation artifact. No `data-update-*` skill applies here. No violation recorded.
- **[D7]** The second `feature-orchestrator` spawn (moving the call from `handlePostCICOValidateLocationSuccess` to `.viewDidLoadEvent`) was a rework spawn — the first execution placed the call in the wrong location. This added ~2 minutes of orchestration overhead for a single-line relocation. The planning step did not specify where in `CICOLocationViewModel` the call should land, allowing the misplacement.
- **[D7]** The delegation guard fired mid-session, requiring user intervention. While the agent handled it correctly (stopped and asked), the guard triggering was a direct consequence of re-entering `feature-orchestrator` for a single-layer correction — which re-wrote `delegation.json` unnecessarily.

> **Low score on D7?** Review `.claude/software-dev-agentic/lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md` — two fixes needed: (1) the plan spec should include the target insertion point in the ViewModel (which `emitEvent` case, which MARK section); (2) single-layer corrections after a completed phase should bypass the full orchestration stack and spawn the layer worker directly with exact coordinates from `state.json`.

## Recommendations

1. **Highest impact fix — Include call-site coordinates in plans.** The rework spawn happened because the plan said "call the use case" without specifying exactly where in `emitEvent(_:)` to place it. Plans for ViewModel wiring should include the target case name and the line-order relative to existing calls (e.g., "append after `actions.accept(.showLoading(false))` in `.viewDidLoadEvent`").

2. **Add Correction Mode to `feature-orchestrator`.** After a phase completes, single-layer corrections should skip the full orchestration stack — no pre-flight, no sub-orchestrator, no delegation flag re-write. Spawn the layer worker directly (`presentation-worker`, `data-worker`, etc.) with exact coordinates from `state.json` artifacts. This eliminates orchestration hop overhead (the main cost driver) and naturally hits prompt cache since the worker reads the same source files within the TTL window. It also prevents the delegation guard from re-firing on correction spawns.

## Effort vs Billing

### Token cost breakdown

| Token type | Count | Unit price | Cost (USD) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Input | 90 | $3.00 / MTok | $0.0003 |
| Cache creation | 151,602 | $3.75 / MTok | $0.5685 |
| Cache reads | 2,918,211 | $0.30 / MTok | $0.8755 |
| Output | 16,151 | $15.00 / MTok | $0.2423 |
| **Total** | **3,086,054 billed-equiv** | | **~$1.69** |

Cache hit ratio of **95.1%** was the primary cost saver — without it, the same session would have cost ~$9.45 at full input rates (savings of ~$7.77).

### Where the tokens went

| Task | Estimated tokens | % of total | Productive? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plan-feature skill + feature-planner execution | ~620,000 | 20% | ✅ Productive |
| Research phase (grep-driven guard condition validation) | ~185,000 | 6% | ✅ Productive |
| Plan.md refinement (3 edit cycles + confirmations) | ~92,000 | 3% | ✅ Productive |
| feature-orchestrator execution (flag + ViewModel wiring) | ~1,240,000 | 40% | ✅ Productive |
| Rework: second feature-orchestrator spawn (viewDidLoad relocation) | ~620,000 | 20% | ❌ Rework |
| Commit staging + git operations | ~185,000 | 6% | ⚠️ Overhead |
| Perf-review script invocation (failed + retry) | ~154,000 | 5% | ⚠️ Overhead |
| **Total** | **~3,096,000** | **100%** | |

**Productive work: ~69% (~2,137,000 tokens / ~$1.17)**
**Wasted on rework: ~20% (~620,000 tokens / ~$0.34)**

### Effort-to-value ratio

| Deliverable | Complexity | Tokens spent | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feature flag in MekariFlagResponse + MekariFlagCustomProvider | Low | ~310,000 | Good — focused, no iteration |
| GetAllLocationLiveAttendanceUseCase injection into CICOLocationViewModel | Medium | ~930,000 | Fair — correct on first pass but placement required a second orchestrator run |
| viewDidLoad relocation correction | Low | ~620,000 | Poor — single-line move consumed ~20% of total tokens due to full orchestration overhead being applied to a trivial correction |

### Key insight

The single highest-cost inefficiency was applying full `feature-orchestrator` orchestration to a one-line call-site relocation. Moving `fetchAllLocationLiveAttendanceIfNeeded()` from one handler to another is a trivially small change, yet it consumed approximately 620,000 tokens (~$0.34) because it went through the full spawn-plan-execute-verify cycle. This was caused by the plan not specifying where the call should be placed initially — a missing coordinate in the plan led to a misplacement, which then required a costly correction pass. Tighter plan specifications (naming the exact `emitEvent` case and insertion order) would have prevented the misplacement entirely and eliminated the rework spawn.
