## Summary Scores

| Dimension | Score | Rating | Key Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 · Orchestration Quality | 8/10 | Good | feature-planner coordinated correctly; feature-orchestrator passed context by path, not contents |
| D2 · Worker Invocation | 7/10 | Good | feature-planner + feature-orchestrator appropriate; no granular layer workers visible at main session level |
| D3 · Skill Execution | 5/10 | Fair | No explicit skill calls recorded; feature-orchestrator likely handled skills internally but zero skill_calls in main session trace |
| D4 · Token Efficiency | 8/10 | Good | 90.2% cache hit ratio; only 3 reads, all necessary; avg 31K billed/turn is acceptable for orchestration turns |
| D5 · Routing Accuracy | 8/10 | Good | /plan-feature skill correctly used as entry point; feature-planner → feature-orchestrator chain is correct for this ticket type |
| D6 · Workflow Compliance | 6/10 | Fair | Work done on feature branch; feature-orchestrator invoked correctly; session ended with incomplete /agentic-perf-review script errors left unresolved |
| D7 · One-Shot Rate | 8/10 | Good | Zero rejected tools; no duplicate reads; user approval flow was clean; minor overhead from failed extract-session.sh runs at the end |
| **Overall** | **7.1/10** | **Good** | |

## Token Breakdown

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Input tokens | 36 |
| Cache creation | 74,901 |
| Cache reads | 690,036 |
| Output tokens | 11,896 |
| **Billed approx** | **776,869** |
| Cache hit ratio | 90.20% |
| Avg billed / turn | 31,075 |

## Tool Usage

| Tool | Calls |
|---|---|
| Bash | 5 |
| Read | 3 |
| Agent | 2 |
| ToolSearch | 1 |
| AskUserQuestion | 1 |

Read:Grep ratio: N/A — 3 Read calls, 0 Grep calls. No Grep was available at the orchestration layer; all 3 reads were necessary (ticket file, context.md, state.json). Not a violation given the targeted reads.

## Agent & Skill Invocations

| Component | Args / Description | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Agent: feature-planner | Plan feature TE-14834 — ticket content passed inline as prompt | Produced context.md + plan.md with full artifact discovery across Domain / Data / Presentation layers |
| Agent: feature-orchestrator | Execute TE-14834 feature plan — context.md + state.json pre-loaded inline | Completed all phases; modified 5 files (LocalStorageKey, AttendanceScheduleRepository, AttendanceScheduleRepositoryImpl, AttendanceScheduleViewModel, LiveAttendanceLivenessViewModel) |

No Skill tool calls were recorded at the main session level. Skills are expected to be invoked by workers inside the feature-orchestrator sub-agent, which runs in a child session not captured in this trace.

## Findings

### What went well

- The /plan-feature skill was used correctly as the entry point, producing a structured plan with full artifact discovery before any code was written.
- The feature-planner correctly identified all 5 files needing change and accurately determined which layers needed no new artifacts (no new DTOs, no DataSource, no new UseCase — only updates to existing contracts).
- context.md was pre-loaded into the feature-orchestrator prompt, correctly avoiding a cold re-read (P8 compliance — intent passed, not files).
- Cache hit ratio of 90.2% kept costs to $0.67 against a no-cache equivalent of $2.47 — a 73% cost saving.
- Zero tool rejections and a clean user-approval flow (AskUserQuestion → "Build now") with no rework cycles.
- The feature-orchestrator completed all phases and suggested a follow-up test generation step rather than leaving the session open-ended.

### Issues found

- **[D3]** Zero skill_calls at the main session level. The expected skills for this work — `domain-create-repository` (updating repository interface), `data-create-repository-impl` (updating RepositoryImpl), `pres-update-stateholder` (two ViewModel updates) — should appear in the session trace. If they were called inside the feature-orchestrator sub-agent they are not observable here, but their absence from the top-level trace makes compliance unverifiable. Score penalized to 5/10 as a result.
- **[D6]** The session ended with three failed `extract-session.sh` runs where the script could not locate the Claude projects directory for this machine's username path. These errors were not resolved — the script was examined but the session ended before a workaround was applied. This left the /agentic-perf-review workflow incomplete within the session itself, requiring a separate manual invocation (this report). The issue is a path-encoding mismatch between the user's home directory slug and the expected Claude projects folder name.
- **[D6]** No PR creation was observed in the session. CLAUDE.md does not explicitly mandate a PR workflow, so this is noted but not penalized.
- **[D2]** The main session only shows two agent spawns (feature-planner, feature-orchestrator). The feature-orchestrator's internal sub-agent spawns (domain-worker, data-worker, presentation-worker) are not visible in this trace. This makes cross-layer ordering and layer-to-worker mapping unverifiable. Scored at 7 rather than 9 due to this observability gap.

> **Low score on D3?** Review `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md` — check whether it instructs workers to call skills for artifact *updates* (not just new creation). The rubric requires skill invocations for updates to existing domain/data/presentation artifacts, and the main session trace shows zero skill calls.

> **Low score on D6?** Review `.claude/software-dev-agentic/scripts/extract-session.sh` — the script uses a path-encoding heuristic for the Claude projects directory that fails when the user's home directory contains a compound username (e.g. `puras.handharmahuamekari.com`). The expected path slug does not match the actual Claude projects folder name on this machine.

## Recommendations

1. **Highest impact fix — fix extract-session.sh path encoding** — The script failed because the home directory path `/Users/puras.handharmahuamekari.com/Workspace/talenta-ios` encodes to `-Users-puras.handharmahuamekari.com-Workspace-talenta-ios` but Claude's actual projects directory uses a different slug. Add a dynamic lookup (e.g. `ls ~/.claude/projects/ | grep talenta`) or allow the script to accept an explicit session JSONL path as a fallback so /agentic-perf-review does not silently fail.
2. **Instrument skill calls in feature-orchestrator output** — The feature-orchestrator's completion summary should list which skills were called per phase. Currently the top-level session trace shows zero skill_calls even though 5 files were modified. Adding a structured "Skills invoked" table to the orchestrator's final report would make D3 scoring objective in future sessions.
3. **Branch naming alignment** — The work for TE-14834 was executed on `feature/TLMN-5158_Setup-software-dev-agentic`, which is the tooling setup branch, not a dedicated TE-14834 branch. Future sessions should create a new branch per ticket (e.g. `feature/TE-14834-reduce-attendance-clocks-status`) to keep git history and PR scope clean.
4. **Follow up with test generation** — The feature-orchestrator explicitly suggested generating tests for `getAyncProcess` flag gating, `populateState` flag persistence, and repository clear-on-empty logic. Run `/test-create-presentation` and `/test-create-data` for the modified ViewModels and RepositoryImpl to close the coverage gap.

## Effort vs Billing

### Token cost breakdown

| Token type | Count | Unit price | Cost (USD) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Input | 36 | $3.00 / MTok | $0.0001 |
| Cache creation | 74,901 | $3.75 / MTok | $0.2809 |
| Cache reads | 690,036 | $0.30 / MTok | $0.2070 |
| Output | 11,896 | $15.00 / MTok | $0.1784 |
| **Total** | **776,869 billed-equiv** | | **~$0.67** |

Cache hit ratio of **90.2%** was the primary cost saver — without it, the same session would have cost ~$2.47 at full input rates, a saving of $1.81 (73%).

### Where the tokens went

| Task | Estimated tokens | % of total | Productive? |
|---|---|---|---|
| feature-planner: codebase exploration + plan generation | ~420,000 | ~54% | Productive |
| feature-orchestrator: context loading + phase execution | ~290,000 | ~37% | Productive |
| /agentic-perf-review failed script runs (3 Bash calls) | ~35,000 | ~5% | Overhead / Wasted |
| Orchestration glue (AskUserQuestion, ToolSearch, ls) | ~30,000 | ~4% | Overhead |
| **Total** | **~776,869** | **100%** | |

**Productive work: ~91% (~707,000 tokens / ~$0.61)**
**Wasted on rework: ~5% (~35,000 tokens / ~$0.04)**

### Effort-to-value ratio

| Deliverable | Complexity | Tokens spent | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feature plan + artifact discovery (context.md + plan.md) | Medium | ~420,000 | Good — full codebase context scan across 3 layers is token-intensive but necessary for accurate artifact discovery |
| 5 file modifications across Domain / Data / Presentation | Medium | ~290,000 | Good — proportionate for a cross-layer flag-gating change coordinated across an orchestrator sub-agent |
| /agentic-perf-review script execution (failed) | Low | ~35,000 | Poor — three failed attempts with the same root cause (path encoding mismatch) consumed 5% of session tokens with no value delivered |

### Key insight

The single highest-cost phase was the feature-planner's codebase exploration, consuming an estimated 54% of total tokens (~420K). This is proportionate: the planner had to scan the AttendanceTM module's Domain, Data, and Presentation layers to determine which of the 9 candidate files needed changes versus skips, and produce a fully-specified plan. The feature-orchestrator then executed cleanly against that plan in 37% of tokens — the front-loaded planning investment paid off in a zero-rework execution phase. The only disproportionate spend was the 5% of tokens burned on three identical `extract-session.sh` failures, all sharing the same root cause that was identified but not resolved within the session.
