## The Problem

Building a feature used to look like this.

An engineer picks up a ticket. They spend the first hour reading existing code — understanding how the project is structured, what patterns to follow, where files should go. Then they write the feature: domain logic, data layer, API wiring, UI. They make decisions along the way that may or may not be consistent with how another engineer solved the same problem last week on a different product.

We have three platforms — **Web**, **iOS**, and **Flutter**. Three codebases. Three sets of conventions. Three places where the same architecture decisions get made differently, drift over time, and create inconsistency that slows down every engineer who touches them next.

This is not a people problem. It is a **system problem**.

---

## What We Built

We built a shared AI engineering toolkit — **software-dev-agentic** — that gives every engineer on every platform access to the same specialized AI team, following the same standards, every time.

It is not a chatbot. It is not autocomplete.

It is a **hierarchy of specialized AI agents** — each one an expert in a specific layer of how we build software — that work together to deliver complete features autonomously.

---

## How It Works

Think of it as a small engineering team, permanently on call.

```
You describe the feature
        ↓
  Project Manager AI        ← understands the full picture, delegates the work
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  Backend Engineer AI    ← domain logic       │
  │  Data Engineer AI       ← APIs and databases │
  │  Frontend Engineer AI   ← state management   │
  │  UI Engineer AI         ← screens and views  │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        ↓
  Complete feature, across all layers, ready for review
```

Each specialist knows exactly what they own, what they don't touch, and what quality looks like. The Project Manager AI coordinates them in the right order, passes only what each needs, and reports back when the work is done.

**The engineer's job shifts from writing boilerplate to reviewing output.**

---

## See It In Action

Here is what building the **Leave Request** feature looks like with this system.

### The team

To keep this readable, here is how the AI specialists map to plain English roles:

| Plain English | What it actually is | What it owns |
|---|---|---|
| Project Manager AI | `feature-orchestrator` | Coordinates the team, decides the order, opens the PR |
| Backend Engineer AI | `domain-worker` | Business logic — entities, rules, use cases |
| Data Engineer AI | `data-worker` | Data layer — API calls, database, mappers |
| Frontend Engineer AI | `presentation-worker` | State management — what the UI shows and responds to |
| UI Engineer AI | `ui-worker` | The actual screens and components the user sees |

### What the engineer types

> *"Build the leave request feature. Employees can submit a request, managers can approve or reject it, and the submitter gets notified of the outcome."*

That is the entire input. One sentence of intent.

### What happens next

The Project Manager AI takes over. It asks three short clarifying questions — what data operations are needed, whether this is a new feature or an update, and whether the platform has a separate UI layer. Then it gets to work.

```
Project Manager AI
│
├── 1. Hands off to Backend Engineer AI
│      → Creates the LeaveRequest entity (the data model)
│      → Creates the repository interface (how data is stored and retrieved)
│      → Creates three use cases:
│           SubmitLeaveRequestUseCase
│           ApproveLeaveRequestUseCase
│           RejectLeaveRequestUseCase
│      ✓ Done. Returns file paths.
│
├── 2. Hands off to Data Engineer AI
│      → Creates the API response model (what the server sends back)
│      → Creates the mapper (translates API data into our domain model)
│      → Creates the data source (the actual API call)
│      → Creates the repository implementation (wires everything together)
│      ✓ Done. Returns file paths.
│
├── 3. Hands off to Presentation Team
│      Frontend Engineer AI → Creates the StateHolder
│                              (manages what the UI shows and responds to)
│      UI Engineer AI       → Creates the screen
│                              (the actual interface the user sees)
│      ✓ Done. Returns file paths.
│
└── Project Manager AI compiles the result, opens a pull request.
```

### What comes out

A complete, production-ready feature across all layers — ready for the engineer to review:

| What was created | Who created it |
|---|---|
| `LeaveRequest` entity | Backend Engineer AI |
| `LeaveRequestRepository` interface | Backend Engineer AI |
| `SubmitLeaveRequestUseCase` | Backend Engineer AI |
| `ApproveLeaveRequestUseCase` | Backend Engineer AI |
| `RejectLeaveRequestUseCase` | Backend Engineer AI |
| API response model + mapper | Data Engineer AI |
| Data source + repository implementation | Data Engineer AI |
| `LeaveRequestViewModel` | Frontend Engineer AI |
| Leave request screen + navigation | UI Engineer AI |
| Pull request opened, linked to ticket | Project Manager AI |

Every file follows our architecture standards. Every layer only knows what it's supposed to know. No shortcuts, no drift.

**Total engineer time invested: one sentence and a code review.**

---

## The Results

We ran this in production across three products — **wehire**, **xpnsio**, and **talenta-iOS** — over four days in April 2026.

### Speed

> A 34-file, 5-layer feature — domain logic, database, API, UI, all wired together — delivered in a single session.

That same feature would have taken a senior engineer 2–3 days. It now takes one session.

### Cost

We measure AI compute cost in tokens — the unit of work an AI model charges for.

| Week | Cost per feature session |
|---|---|
| Baseline (Apr 10) | 737,000 tokens |
| After 4 days of tuning | 103,000 tokens |

**85% reduction in AI compute cost in four calendar days.**

Not from switching to a cheaper model. From building the system correctly — specialists working in isolation, sharing only what they need to share.

### Quality

We score every session across 7 dimensions: how well the AI coordinated, routed work, followed standards, and got it right the first time. Scale is 1–10.

| Period | Average Score |
|---|---|
| First sessions | 6.3 / 10 |
| After one week | 8.0 / 10 |

The system improves itself. Every session produces a performance report. Every performance report drives a toolkit update. Every toolkit update makes the next session better — across all three products simultaneously.

---

## What Makes This Different

### One toolkit, every platform

The same AI engineering team works on Web, iOS, and Flutter. The architectural rules are shared. Platform-specific knowledge — Swift syntax, TypeScript patterns, Dart conventions — is swapped in automatically based on the project.

An improvement made for wehire ships to xpnsio and talenta the same day.

### It enforces our standards automatically

Every feature built through this system follows our architecture. The AI agents don't know how to cut corners on it — it's not in their instructions.

This means less time in code review catching architecture drift. Less time onboarding engineers onto "how we do things here." Less technical debt accumulating quietly in the codebase.

### It compounds

The first week produced 6 rounds of improvements. Each round made the system measurably better. The more we use it, the better it gets — and every improvement is shared instantly across all products.

---

## What This Means for the Business

**We ship faster.** Features that took days take sessions.

**We ship consistently.** The same standards, every platform, every time.

**We scale without proportional headcount.** The AI team handles the repeatable, structured work. Engineers handle judgment, product decisions, and review.

**Our AI costs are going down, not up.** As the system matures, it becomes more efficient — not more expensive.

---

## Where We're Going

The toolkit today covers feature development, debugging, testing, and architecture review.

What's next:

**More platforms.** Flutter support is in progress. Android is on the roadmap. The architecture is built to add a new platform with no changes to the shared system.

**Broader scope.** The same agent model that builds features can be applied to performance analysis, security review, and migration automation.

**Shorter feedback loops.** The gap between "a developer describes intent" and "a feature is ready for review" continues to shrink.

---

## In One Sentence

We built a system where an engineer describes what they want to build, and a team of specialized AI agents builds it correctly — across every platform, at a fraction of the cost, every time.
